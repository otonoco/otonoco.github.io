The Waste Land

"After the torchlight red on sweaty faces
After the frosty silence in the gardens
After the agony in stony places
The crying and the shouting
Prison and place and reverberation
Of thunder of spring over distant mountains
He was living is now dead
We who were living are now dying
With a little patience"

-T.S. Eliot

### Some Boring Stuff

I just submitted my summer internship application to some of the most prestigious hedge funds, including Citadel, Two Sigma, SIG, and Jane Street. With all good luck I wish the interviewers would appreciate my attitude to learn and talent. 3/5/2020.

It is my first day of blogging. I am still learning how to deploy a customized blog website using Jekyll. 3/2/2020.

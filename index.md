## Welcome to My Blog

From Chengdu, China, I am a sophomore college student studying Electrical Engineering and Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science currently at Chicago, IL. Extracurricularly, I watch football games (both American and British football), read fiction novels, and write political reviews.

The Waste Land

"After the torchlight red on sweaty faces
After the frosty silence in the gardens
After the agony in stony places
The crying and the shouting
Prison and place and reverberation
Of thunder of spring over distant mountains
He was living is now dead
We who were living are now dying
With a little patience"

-T.S. Eliot
